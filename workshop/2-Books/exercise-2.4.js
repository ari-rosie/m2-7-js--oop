In our BookList, we have properties to track:
- The last book we've read
- The book we're currently reading
- The next book up

We're not using these properties yet; they're always null.

Our new task is to make them functional. When we add our first book to the
list, `currentlyReading` should get set to it.

We need two new methods:

- startReading
- finishReading

Both of these methods will take a book title, as a string.

When we start reading a book, we should set the `currentlyReading` property
to point to it.

When we finish reading a book, we should set `currentlyReading` back to `null`,
and set `lastRead` to the book we just finished.

Your goal is to add the methods and behaviour necessary so that the following
code runs well and produces the expected output.
